\title{Compute Changepoint Model}
\usage{
BinSegModel(data, algorithm, distribution, numCpts = 1, minSegLen = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector containing the input data.}

\item{algorithm}{A string with the algorithm to be used. Currently only "BS" (Binary Segmentation) is implemented.}

\item{distribution}{A string with the distribution to be used. Use BinSegInfo to check the available
distributions and their description.}

\item{numCpts}{Integer determining the number of changepoints to be computed. Must be at least one. For the norm_mean
distribution, as the variance is assumed to be constant, there can be up to N number of changepoints. However, for every
other distribution, there are at most N/2.}

\item{minSegLen}{Integer determining the minimum segment length. For the norm_mean distribution, the minimum segment
length is 1. However, for all the other ones it is 2, since each segment must have two data points to calculate variance.}
}
\value{
A BinSeg object containing the models_summary data table, as well as extra information such as the distribution,
algorithm, number of changepoints, and parameters.
}
\description{
This is the main function of the BinSeg package. It performs changepoint analysis on the provided data using the
selected algorithm and distribution. Computes the optimal changepoints and estimates the parameters in each segment.
Note that it is possible to view segmentation models from 1 up to the selected number of changepoints, by using
the methods provided by the BinSeg Class.
}
\section{Details}{

This is the only function that must be called to perform a new changepoint analysis with the BinSeg package. Internally,
it first makes several validations to the input parameters. After this, it calls the binseg function, which connects
with C++ code using Rcpp. Later on it makes some modifications to the returned matrix (which will be used as models_summary
data table) and creates a new BinSeg object which is returned. Note that in order to use any of the methods from the
BinSeg class you must use this function instead of directly calling the binseg function.

\examples{
# Create a vector with four different segments that differ in mean
data  <-  c(rnorm(10, 0, 10), rnorm(10, 100, 10), rnorm(10, 200, 10), rnorm(10, 300, 10))
# Compute a changepoint model using the Binary Segmentation algorithm and a normal distribution with
# change in mean. Calculating models up to three changepoints.
ans <- BinSeg::BinSeg(data=data, algorithm="BS", distribution="mean_norm", numCpts=3, minSegLen=1)

}
\seealso{
BinSegInfo to know the available algorithms and distributions, binseg to check out
the Rcpp function. BinSeg to check the return class sructure and available methods.
